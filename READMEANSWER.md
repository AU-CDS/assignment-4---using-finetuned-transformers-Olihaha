# assignemnt 4 - solution
in my script i generate both an image with and without the "neutral" emotion included. I have opted to compare the two without the neutral emotion.
In the out folder i have included 2 images, and 6 csv files. 
I dont understand why but my csv files only includes the count and not the emotion, which maybe you could help me with?
I have included a run_script.sh file and a requirements.txt

## comparing real and fake emotions

The emotional distribution of real news exposes fear as the most frequent emotion with 555 incidents, chased by anger at 383 incidents, sadness at 245 incidents, disgust at 186 incidents, surprise at 90 incidents, and joy at 63 incidents.

Similar to real news, the fakes news had 521 incidents of fear with 412 incident of anger. There was a different in disgust and sadness being switched around with 248 cases of digsut and 242 cases of sadness which is opposite to the real news. Finally htere was 92 cases of joy.

## takeaways
Across both real and fake news, fear and anger emerge as the leading emotions. An interesting observation is that fake news appears to initiate similar emotional responses as real news, suggesting that emotional manipulation can be employed in either format of news content. The presence of emotions in news can potentially impact readers' perception and interpretation of the news, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating news sources and content.

Based on the similary this naturally also indicates that emotion is clearly not a good indication of real vs fake news.
